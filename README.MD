# AWS CloudFormation Examples

This repository contains example templates for [AWS CloudFormation](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/), aimed at helping you automate and manage your AWS infrastructure as code.

Each template is written in either JSON and is focused on solving a specific use case.

## 📁 Structure

Templates are organized by category or service, for example:

- `compute/` – EC2 instance examples  
- `compute/` – S3 bucket configurations 
- `iam/` – IAM roles, policies, and users  

## 🚧 Work in Progress

This is a growing collection — I'm adding new templates over time as I explore more AWS services and best practices. Feel free to check back for updates, or contribute your own examples if you’d like!
